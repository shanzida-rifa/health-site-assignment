                Health services consist of medical professionals, organizations, and ancillary health care workers who provide medical care to those in need. Health services serve patients, families, communities, and populations. They cover emergency, preventative, rehabilitative, long-term, hospital, diagnostic, primary, palliative, and home care. These services are centered around making health care accessible, high quality, and patient-centered. Many different types of care and providers are necessary in order to offer successful health services.

                Gary didn't realize how many health services options have been around him. He usually uses his primary care physician, who is a medical doctor, for his medical needs. He's a young and healthy man, so he hasn't had to deal with other, more involved health services. However, he does have a grandmother in a long-term care facility that he visits every couple of weeks. The guidance counselor continues explaining the different types of health services that are available.
